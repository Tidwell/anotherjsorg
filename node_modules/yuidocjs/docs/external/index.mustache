<p>
YUIDoc generates a `data.json` file after it parses your API documentation. 
The `external.data` config option enables you to import a YUIDoc `data.json` file 
from another project and mix it into your own documentation. 
</p>

<p>
This feature is handy when you are extending another project and would like to link back
to their API documentation. For example, importing YUI Library's `data.json`
file would enable YUIDoc to automatically link back to `Base`, `EventTarget`, and
other core YUI objects that your own API might be extending or mixing in. 
</p>

<p>
Currently, importing external data enables YUIDoc to resolve HTML links `@extends` or `@use` keywords, 
but does <em>not</em> cause YUIDoc to generate complete documentation for the external API.
Future versions of YUIDoc may provide the option to mix in the data natively 
and reproduce the external API right along with your own.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>
    Create an `external` object under the `options` object in your `yuidoc.json` file and give it
    a property called `data` pointing to the URL of the external `data.json` file you wish to import. 
    `data` can be a string or an array of strings. 
</p>

```
{
  "options": {
    "external": {
      "data": "http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/data.json"
    }
  }
}
```

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> YUIDoc currently fetches external data on each run with no caching.
